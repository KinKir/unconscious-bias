    section: Clear, Objective Discipline Procedures
    template: >
      The teachers and administrators at ${school}
      have procedures for identifying and responding to
      behavior incidents in our building and review them for
      mally on a regular basis. Our orientation materials and
      school website include definitions for the most common
      problem behaviors we see in our school, as well
      as examples of how these behaviors can range from
      minor, staff-managed behaviors to major, officemanaged
      behaviors. Here is one example (from SWIS,
      our discipline data system):

      Disruption (Minor): “Student engages in low-intensity,
      but inappropriate disruption, such as chatting with a
      peer in class with a whisper tone.”

      Disruption (Major): “Student engages in behavior
      causing an interruption in a class or activity. Disruption
      includes sustained loud talk, yelling, or screaming; noise
      with materials; horseplay or roughhousing; and/or sustained
      out-of-seat behavior.”

    section: Removal or Reduction of Exclusionary Practices
    text: > 
      ${school} is working to keep students
      in school with continuous access to instruction and
      reduce the practice of removing students from their
      classrooms for disciplinary reasons. Suspensions and
      expulsions are reserved for serious behavior incidents
      that pose a credible threat to the safety of our students
      and staff. More information on suspensions and expulsions,
      including the appeals process for families, can be
      found on the school's Student Discipline Webpage. 

      For serious behavior incidents that do not require mandatory
      expulsion, the multidisciplinary team at ${school} will
      determine appropriate interventions
      in lieu of out-of-school suspension. Students who
      are involved in behavior incidents in this category are
      required to participate in activities designed to support
      development of prosocial skills. See our Graduated
      Discipline Policy for alternative responses.

    section: Graduated Discipline Systems with Instructional Alternatives to Exclusion
    text: >
      ${school} believes in the use of graduated discipline
      to ensure severe punishments, such as exclusion
      from the learning environment, are reserved for credible
      threats to the safety of others. The goal of all discipline
      responses is to ensure students understand the
      school’s behavior expectations, repair the harm caused
      by their choice of behavior, and identify how to prevent
      the problem in the future. When repeated or serious
      behavior incidents occur, each school’s multidisciplinary
      team will conduct a functional behavior assessment for
      students to identify needs for academic and behavior
      support.
