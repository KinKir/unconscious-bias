# Why bias matters {#why}
Because equity matters.

As we work to scale access to math, science, arts and engineering learning experiences to more students in the United States, we risk reproducing reproducing enrollment, retention and achievement patterns that do not reflect the whole of society.

As we scale access to formal and informal educational opportunities to engage with computational thinking and computer science, there's an opportunity to spread values of equity and cultural competency in teaching that can help create an inclusive community.  Since these issues of equity and diversity are similar in other fields like math, science and engineering more broadly, we'll also learn from and work with folks in other STEM fields.

Studies across a variety of fields from education, medicine, law enforcement, criminal justice, hiring, rental that people use race, ethnicity and gender in making key decisions that shape people's lives.  Implicit bias in a promising line of research for understanding how this happens and how we can improve.

## Gaps in enrollment, discipline and achievement
Black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended or expelled as their white peers ([Office for Civil Rights 2014](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-discipline-snapshot.pdf)).  This difference is visible even in preschool (see [Gilliam 2016](http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/Preschool%20Implicit%20Bias%20Policy%20Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379.pdf)).

> Black and Latino students are 38% of students in schools that offer Algebra
II and 37% of students enrolled in Algebra II; they are 36% of students in
schools that offer calculus and 21% of students enrolled in calculus; and they are 37% of students in schools that offer physics and
35% of students enrolled in physics. ([Office for Civil Rights 2016](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2013-14-first-look.pdf)).

While female students are generally more successful in K12 settings than male students, they report liking math and science less than male students ([NCES 2015](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015075.pdf)).  In upper high school grades, when students have more choice over their course of study, girls opt-out of specific math and science courses ([Blickenstaff 2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540250500145072)).

> In high school, the Advanced Placement exam in Computer Science has the worst gender diversity across all courses, with 78 percent participation by men and 22 percent by women. Participation by students of color is 13 percent. ([College Board 2007](http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2007-4-ap-students-college-analysis-five-year-academic-careers.pdf))

This also impact AP mathematics, where boys consistently outnumber girls by up to 10,000 students.  It's even more pronounced in STEM programs in career and technical education, where females only make up 25% of students ([Office for Civil Rights 2012](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/gender-equity-in-education.pdf)).

## How does implicit bias fit in?
While these outcomes show that we have work to do in terms of equity, it's complicated to understand all the factors contributing to these different outcomes and what we can do about it.  One promising line of research from psychology is implicit bias, which has been studied extensively over the last 15 years.

## How do students experience bias?
- [Sepehr Vakil](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/sepehr_vakil) has done excellent field work on how students of different races, ethnicities and genders experience computer science education.
- If you're a student, or work directly with students we'd love to [hear from you](https://twitter.com/mit_tsl) and help share your experience.

## What can bias in teaching look like?
We've put together an initial set of ways that bias can surface in teaching that may be influenced by implicit bias, and would love your input.

## What else can we do?
A lot!  While we're focused on improving equity in K12 STEM teaching, and helping teachers prepare and practice to create more equitable classroom communities, many other people are working on other aspects of these problems.

There's lots of work to build the capacity of teacher preparation programs in teaching computer science and embedding computational thinking:

- [Certificate in Computer Science Education](Certificate in Computer Science Education) from St. Scholastica
- [WeTeach_CS](https://www.weteachcs.org/) from UT Austin's Center for STEM Education
- [Foundations of Computer Science for Teachers](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-computer-science-teachers-utaustinx-ut-wtcs-15-01x) online course
- [Alliance for California Computing Education for Students and Schools](http://access-ca.org/)

And many efforts to increase access for students:

- [Computer Science For All](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all)
- [code.org](https://code.org/)
- [Google RISE](https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/google-rise-awards/)
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [ScratchEd](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/)
- [Project GUTS](http://www.projectguts.org/)
- [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/)

And researchers are working to investigate how teachers can best promote access and equity:
