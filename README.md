# Why bias matters {#why}
Because equity matters.

When looking at groups of students in aggregate, there are clear gaps in outcomes for students grouped based on race, ethnicity, gender, disability and class.  This shows up in high-level measures like achievement, retention and graduation even at the national level.  In addition, pathways towards STEM careers are increasingly important to many students, families, educators and policy makers.  Yet the STEM pipeline also shows clear gaps in outcomes for students grouped by race, ethnicity, gender, disability and class.

It's clear that intersectionality is important and students each have their own unique lived experience.  And that the cultures of different schools, cities and regions shape student experiences as well.  Nevertheless, high-level gaps in students outcomes based on single demographic characteristics reveal critical equity issues in the education system that should be targeted for research and intervention.

As the [MIT Teaching Systems Lab](http://tsl.mit.edu/) works with K12 educators, teacher preparation programs, and other organizations to scale access to new STEM opportunities, we all risk replicating these gaps in areas like computational thinking and making.

Implicit bias is a promising line of research for understanding and addressing these issues in K12 education.  Studies across a variety of fields including education, medicine, law enforcement, criminal justice, and housing suggest that people unconsciously consider race, ethnicity and gender when making key decisions that shape other people's lives.  Research into implicit bias may reveal insight into how to reduce gaps in K12 student outcomes and how we can improve.

## Gaps in K12 student outcomes 
Black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended or expelled as their white peers ([OCR 2016](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-discipline-snapshot.pdf)).  This difference is visible even in preschool (see [Gilliam 2016](http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/Preschool%20Implicit%20Bias%20Policy%20Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379.pdf)), and there are important intersectional effects for black female students ([Crenshaw 2014](http://www.law.columbia.edu/null/download?&exclusive=filemgr.download&file_id=613546)).  Black and Latino students are 36% of students in schools with calculus, but only make up 21% of students enrolled in calculus ([Office for Civil Rights 2016](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2013-14-first-look.pdf)).

While female students are more academically successful in K12 settings than male students, they report liking math and science less than male students ([NCES 2015](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015075.pdf)).  In upper high school grades, when students have more choice over their course of study, girls opt-out of specific math and science courses ([Blickenstaff 2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540250500145072)).  For career and technical education programs, girls make up 25% of students in STEM courses ([OCR 2012](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/gender-equity-in-education.pdf)).  Within AP courses, more girls make up 61% of biology students and 55% of Environmental Science students, but only 35% of Physics students (all courses) and 23% of Computer Science students ([College Board 2007](http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2007-4-ap-students-college-analysis-five-year-academic-careers.pdf)).  This is particularly important because students enrolled in AP courses are more likely to major in those subjects in college, especially for STEM subjects ([College Board 2014](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-student-success-college-recent-research.pdf)).

Students with disabilities are 12% of all students, but 67% of students subject to restraint or seclusion ([OCR 2016](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2013-14-first-look.pdf)).

# How bias can surface in teaching {#teaching}

## Teachers' uniquely important role
Gershenson, Holt and Papageorge ([2013](http://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=up_workingpapers)) summarize some hypotheses around how bias in teaching can impact students:

> Indeed, robust evidence suggests gender, racial, and ethnic biases in how teachers grade exams in a variety of contexts (Burgess and Greaves 2013; Cornwell, Mustard, and Van Parys 2013; Hanna and Linden 2012; Lavy 2008). Lavy and Sand (2015) show that grading biases can have long-lasting impacts on academic achievement and course taking in high school. Relatedly, Riegle-Crumb and Humphries (2012) study how math teachers stigmatize female students.”

> Teachers’ expectations might affect student outcomes in at least three ways. First, the perception that teachers have low expectations may exacerbate the harmful effects of stereotype threat, whereby low expectations either cause emotional responses that directly harm performance or cause students to disidentify with educational environments (Steele 1997).

> Second, stigmatized students may modify their expectations, and in turn their behavior, to conform to teachers’ negative biases (Ferguson 2003). In each of the first two cases, teachers’ stigmatization of information-poor racial minority students could create a feedback loop that functions like a self-fulfilling prophecy (Burgess and Greaves 2013; Loury 2009).

>Finally, teachers who stigmatize certain types of students may modify how they teach, evaluate, and advise them, again leading to poor educational outcomes for stigmatized students (Ferguson 2003). All three scenarios potentially perpetuate sociodemographic gaps in educational attainment.“

## How do students experience bias?
- [Sepehr Vakil](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/sepehr_vakil) has done excellent field work on how students of different races, ethnicities and genders experience computer science education.
- If you're a student, or work directly with students we'd love to [hear from you](https://twitter.com/mit_tsl) and help share your experience.

## How does implicit bias fit in?
While these outcomes show that we have work to do in terms of equity, it's complicated to understand all the factors contributing to these different outcomes and what we can do about it.  One promising line of research from psychology is implicit bias, which has been studied extensively over the last 15 years.

When investigating attitudes towards different groups of people, researchers draw a distinction between attitudes that are measured explicitly (eg., by asking the person to describe their attitude) or implicitly (by measuring how they respond to a particular task).  Often implicit attitude measures are done covertly, without the participant knowing that their attitude is being assessed.  This approach is appealing because one possibility is that people are hesitant to report unpopular attitudes like racism in explicit measures.  This is called the social desirability bias.  Another reason implicit attitude measures are interesting is that levels of attitudes like racism and sexism have declined over time using explicit attitude measures ([Schuman, Steeh, & Bobo, 1998](https://www.amazon.com/Racial-Attitudes-America-Interpretations-Revised/dp/0674745698)), yet there are still different outcomes for racial, ethnic and gender groups in many school and work situations.

Implicit bias is commonly measured by asking participants to classify different concepts or attributes with different groups of people, and researchers will measure how long the participant takes to do the classification.  The most prevalent implicit bias assessment is the [Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html).  Another common approach to measuring implicit bias is to use priming techniques where a participant is shown people from different groups before they complete a task, while researchers measure how their performance changes.

## What can bias in teaching look like?
We've put together an initial set of ways that bias can surface in teaching that may be influenced by implicit bias, and would love your input.

## What else can we do?
A lot!  While we're focused on improving equity in K12 STEM teaching, and helping teachers prepare and practice to create more equitable classroom communities, many other people are working on other aspects of these problems.

There's lots of work to build the capacity of teacher preparation programs in teaching computer science and embedding computational thinking:

- [Certificate in Computer Science Education](Certificate in Computer Science Education) from St. Scholastica
- [WeTeach_CS](https://www.weteachcs.org/) from UT Austin's Center for STEM Education
- [Foundations of Computer Science for Teachers](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-computer-science-teachers-utaustinx-ut-wtcs-15-01x) online course
- [Alliance for California Computing Education for Students and Schools](http://access-ca.org/)

And many efforts to increase access for students:

- [Computer Science For All](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all)
- [code.org](https://code.org/)
- [Google RISE](https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/google-rise-awards/)

- [Project GUTS](http://www.projectguts.org/)
- [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/)

And researchers are working to investigate how teachers can best promote access and equity:
