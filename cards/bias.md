----------------------------
Programs often struggle to articulate precisely what equity practices look like.  In CS, this is not an issue.
In explicit surveys, teachers often express that they don't agree with the values within CS teacher preparation programs (Franke).
In teacher education literature, this is corroborated as well (eg, Milner).


bias = intelligence
unconscious bias = assumptions
unconscious bias != pro or positive attitudes (from "favorable or unfavorable dispositions toward social objects, such as people, places, and policies" in Greenwald and Banaji 1995)




# Bias broadly
### What is bias?
(see Teaching Tolerance)
There are many different aspects of bias, but for the purpose of understanding how bias impacts teachers, we'll define it like this:

  Bias is when an educator makes assumptions about a student that influence their interactions and decisions, regardless of whether those assumptions are true.

(See Greenwald and Banaji (1995) for different conceptions of stereotypes in the social psychology literature.)
(?this is just synonmyous with "judgement")

This bias can impact students in ways that are positive or negative, and educators might be conscious and intentionally making these assumptions, or it might be unconscious and they might not be aware of how their assumptions are influencing their decisions.

Examples:
  - I had Thomas' sister last year and she worked really hard, so he'll probably work hard as well.
  - I've seen that student running around like crazy during recess, so he'll probably have trouble staying focused in class.
  - Rosa's a hispanic young women on the free lunch program, so she probably won't have much support at home.
  - Something has changed about Jayden's energy level in class, so it's probably about something that happened at home.
  - 

(?these are evaluations and expectations, not decisions)

Also, we agree with Forscher et al. (2015) that "although subtle forms of discrimination can certainly be consequential for the well-being of minorities... they make up only a subset of the discrimination minorities face."

Well, all there underlying differences in behavior for say suspensions?  Skiba et al. (2012) found that "for racial disparities in discipline, however, school level variables, including principal perspective on discipline, appear to be stronger predictors of disproportionality in suspension and expulsion than either behavioral or individual characteristics."

Relatedly, "in an average middle school, Black and Hispanic students have less favorable experiences of safety, connectedness, relationships with adults, and opportunities for participation compared to White student" (Voight et al. 2015)


### How do individual people acquire biases?
Teachers might form assumptions based on their own individual experiences and history, inaccurate perceptions of population patterns (eg., everyone in the city bikes), or accurate perception of population patterns (eg., most MIT graduates have taken programming classes).  They are "shaped by our lived experiences and the broader social contexts in which we live and work" (Gerhsehson and Dee 2017).

(statistical discrimination, from our own experiences, from media representations.)
(from making inferences about outcomes that are biased in ways we are not aware of, like olympic swimmers by race)

"Just as a loan officer at a bank uses an applicant’s race to predict whether she will default on a loan, a police officer uses a pedestrian’s race to predict whether he has committed a crime" (Uhlmann et al. 2010)

(look at "UB - Our work")
It's probably impossible to stop this process of making assumptions; there are lots of reasons why making assumptions based on limited information is a useful strategy.  For the individual in power, it's often makes sense to use this information and this is particular true in situations where there's a large amount of relational distance like hiring.  As an example, Bertrand and Mullanaithan (2004) suggest that "our results must imply that employers use race as a factor when reviewing resumes, which matches the legal definition of discrimination."  Even within pure statistical decision making frameworks, this approach of "fairness through unawareness" "ineffective due to the existence of redundant encodings, ways of predicting protected attributes from other features (Hardt et al. 2016 citing Pedreschi et al. 2008).  Extending this to social, relational work like teaching is an even further challenge - teachers' "unawareness" of intersectional identities when interacting with students is a key aspect of developing cultural awareness (Milner; Self 2016).  Further, using "unbiasing" as a intervention approach may actually reinforce colorblind mindsets in decisions where "unbiased does not mean color blind" (Cross et al. 1989).  In medicine, "standardization is one approach to avoid harmful or discriminatory practices...care delivered in this fashion is analogous to cultural blindness... [and] does not necessarily provide the best care for that individual patient." (Engebretson et al. 2007).  


For example, if you meet someone and have to evaluate whether they work as a teacher, and all you know is their race and gender, it would make sense to guess that more white women are teachers since that's statistically true in the United States.

(authentic signals)
Similarly, if you met someone and only knew they were quite tall and muscular, it would make sense to guess that they're an athlete.  Or if you're trying to evaluate someone's class status and you see that they have an expensive piece of clothing, it makes sense to assume they're from a higher class status.

(certifications, quality indicators.)
(beliefs in meritocracy - college graduation by class status / graduation rates by race)
(judging based on outcomes with belief in fair measurement - preparatory privilege)

In relational work like teaching the situation is quite different.  Teachers often can come to know quite a bit about their students, and these relationships are a central part of teaching.  So how can bias impact these relationships?

(biased by part performance, transcript.  differentiation is positive though too - what's the difference?)

(connect to "we're not average people")

Work in psychology considers whether stereotypes are "accurate," meaning that they accurately capture distributional patterns in a way that would be in alignment with statistical discrimination (Jussim et al. 2016).  If not "people’s judgments of these distributions [racial/ethnic differences in high school or college graduate rates] would be almost entirely unrelated to the actual distributions" (Jussim web)...
"The same principles hold for groups about whom it is socially unacceptable to hold stereotypes based on gender, nationality, race, social class, religion, or ethnicity. If the stereotype is approximately accurate and one only has a small bit of ambiguous information about an individual, using the stereotype as a basis for judging the person will likely enhance accuracy... In situations where one has abundant, vividly clear information about an individual, the stereotype becomes completely irrelevant." (Jussim web2)


maybe implicit and explicit evaluation systems, in the style of dual-processing theories (see Gawronski and Bodenhausen 2011 for a review http://www.bertramgawronski.com/documents/GB2011AESP.pdf)



### How do we know that this happens?
(core: bertrand and duflo field studies, also Pager and Western 2012)
(first impression research, anecdote)
(?are all these name studies confounded by class associations?)
(extend: impacts machine learning eg FATML because statistical discrimination is fundamental)

"we are not aware of any research demonstrating that inferences based on the face, voice, or body movement lead to discriminatory
or prejudicial outcomes" (Cox et al. 2017)


### How can we characterize bias and discrimination in general?
"a bigot is simply a sociologist without credentials" (D’Souza, 1995 in Uhlmann et al. 2010)

Interdisciplinary work here is important, as "discrimination analysis is a multi-disciplinary problem, involving sociological causes, legal argumentations, economic models, statistical techniques, computational issues" (Romei and Ruggieri 2013).  Uhlmann et al. (2010) cites work across politics, anthropology, econonmics, philosophy, law and psychology.

Core arguments: accuracy (Jussim) or not (Uhlmann et al. 2010).

> Engelhardt describes examples where using patient records to inform medical decisions can lead to erroneous recommendation systems for diagnosis as well as harmful medical interventions. For example, the symptoms of heart disease differ substantially between men and women, and so do their appropriate treatments. Most data collected about this condition was from men, leaving a blind spot for the diagnosis of heart disease in women. Bias, in this case, is useful and should be maintained for correct medical interventions. In another example, however, data was collected from a variety of hospitals in somewhat segregated poor and wealthy areas. The data appear to show that cancers in children from hispanic and caucasian races develop differently. However, inferences based on this data fail to take into account the biasing effect of economic status in determining at which stage of symptoms different families decide seek medical help. In turn, this determines the stage of development at which the oncological data is collected. The recommendation system with this type of bias confuses race with economic barriers to medical help, which will lead to harmful diagnosis and treatments (Zevenbergen web 2017 describing Barbara Engelhardt).

(Zucker and Prieto 1977)

In economics, there are several models of discrimination, including taste-based (Becker 1961), statistical discrimination (Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973) but "taste-based and statistical discrimination theories... are extremely difficult to distinguish in terms of observable behaviors" (Fernandez and Greenberg 2013).

Statistical discrimination operates "without assuming racial or gender animus, or preference bias, against members of a targeted group" (Fang and Moro 2011).  Echoing the review in Anwar and Fang (2012), this has been studied by many researchers:

> For example, Goldin and Rouse (2000) and Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), among others,
studied disparities in employment; Ross (1997) and Ross and Yinger (1999, 2002) in mortgage lending; Knowles, Persico, and Todd (2001), Anwar and Fang (2006), Grogger and Ridgeway (2006) and Antonovics and Knight (2009) in motor vehicle stops and searches; Anwar, Bayer, and Hjalmarsson (2012) in jury decisions; Ayres and Waldfogel (1994) and Bushway and Gelbach (2010) in bail setting; Alesina and La Ferrara (2009) in prosecution and capital sentencing; Mechoulan and Sahuguet (2011) in parole releases; and Price and Wolfers (2010) in sports refereeing.

Also in Brescoll et al. 2010, judgements of mistakes in gender-incongruous professions.

Continuing, Anwar and Fang (2012) note that:

> Another approach commonly taken is to infer prejudice from racial disparities in care prescribed by the physicians to patients. For example, Schulman, Berlin, Harless, abd Shyrl Sistrunk, Gersh, Dub, Taleghani, Burke, Williams, Eisenberg, Ayers, and Escarce (1999) assessed physicians’ recommendations for management of chest pain after they viewed vignettes of “patients” who complained of symptoms of coronary artery disease. “Patients” varied only in race, sex, age, level of coronary risk and the results of an exercise stress test... However, it is possible that the lower catheterization utilization rates observed among black patients reflect an effort by the physicians to provide more appropriate care to these patients."

Statistical discrimination tested directly in medicine by looking at beliefs as priors:  (see Balsa, McGuire, and Meridith 2005).

This is challenging because "Claims of biased decision making are typically hard to rigorously assess" (Simoiu et al. 2016).

- benchmarking (young black men are more disruptive, that's why they're suspended more), problem here is the "qualified pool" or "denominator" problem
- outcome test (students who were suspended responded positively to the intervention), problem here si the "infra-marginality" problem
- demographic partity (Hardt et al. 2016) (decide to suspend at equivalent rates given the same situation?)

(fuzzy below)
In education, is benchmarking a "reasonable business practice" in the context of office referrals?  Almost certainly not.  How about the outcome test, where we measure the impact of suspension as an intervention?  This is almost certainly inappropriate (see research that suspension harm).  Another way to say this is: how should the teacher's decision be optimized?  It should be based on whether students of different races have the best chance as succeeding given their intervention.

This has been called as "outcome test" (Anwar and Fang 2010, describing Becker 1957; Becker 1993).
One problem with outcomes tests is if there are underlying differences in those populations (that may be from historical or other reasons, not from inherent differences).  This is called the "infra-marginality problem" and an alternative approach mitigating this is a "threshold test," where the risk and decisions are estimated jointly (Simoiu et al. 2016).  Ultimately, optimizing the decision strategy depends on the goal.  Hardt et al. (2016) have looked at this within supervised learning and focused on a goal of "equality of opportunity," where the true positive rate is optimized across groups (see also Watternberg et al. 2016 for visualizations).  In a teaching situation where there is a binary "refer to office or keep in class" decision, this would mean optimizing for "the same rate of "keep in class" repsonse across identity groups for students who would respond well to that strategy.  Connecting across literatures here makes clear there are values, goals, and educational practices that may influence decisions as well.

Similarly in social psychology: "because natural possession versus nonpossession of almost any socially stigmatizing attribute tends to be correlated with possession of other characteristics that are not (and often cannot be) removed by blinding, effective blinding of the sort producible in experiments is often not achievable in practice" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).

This is particularly meaningful "because race is confounded with ecology in the United States, Americans’ stereotypes about racial groups may actually reflect their stereotypes about these groups’ presumed home ecologies" (careful with this: Williams et al. 2015).  In this work, their conclusion is that "In the social inference process, ecology information trumps race."

an organism chooses a fast or slow life history strategy, based on its ecology
harsh and unpredictable ecologies lead to a fast life history strategy
different ecologies have different behavioral and psychological tendencies
ecology is useful cue in predicting others' behavior
In the United States, races are differentially
distributed across ecologies



### What might be the underlying mechanisms?
(historical: Allport attitudes)
One hypothesis is related to dual-processing theories (eg., Kahneman 2011, as discussed in Dee and Gershenson 2017).  This in particular implies that unconscious bias will be visible in situations with instantaneous, automatic decision-making (Dee and Gershenson 2017).  A related hypothesis is that "attentional focus attenuates weak automatic influences on judgment" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).

Another is focused on "implicit social cognition", the idea that "the influence earlier experience is... unavailable to self-report or introspection" that originated in research into memory and importantly is linked to "past experience" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).  For implicit constructs, "direct measures... are necessarily inadequate for its study" and alternative measures must "neither inform the subject of what is being assessed nor request self-report concerning it" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).  This line of research defines implicit attitudes as: "implicit attitudes are introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately
identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).

Individuation information might counteract this (see Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1996; Kunda & Thagard, 1996, as cited in Jussim)

Even if some stereotypes are objectively accurate, an individual's act of stereotyping need not be driven by rationality.  Uhlmann et al. (2010) found that "stereotyping of members of stigmatized groups is often driven by threats to one’s self-esteem and a desire to rationalize inequality, and declines when the perceiver is motivated to be accurate... Bayesian racism correlates highly with negative feelings toward minorities and the desire to keep
low-status groups in their place, and correlates negatively with indices of rational thinking."

Skeptical: "Knowing that someone has sustained a bruised ego tends to be a good predictor of his use of stereotypes" (Uhlmann et al. 2010).

"people rely on stereotypes because doing so supports their conviction that the existing social system is just, fair, and good" (Ulhmann et al. 2010)

"shifting standards model of stereotype-based judgments" (see Axt et al. 2016a) or "casuistry" where people change rationale after the fact (see Axt et al. 2016a for citations)

"This literature suggests that bias correction can occur automatically and without awareness" (see Axt et al. 2016a for citations)


### How can we measure conscious and unconscious bias?
(core: Bertrand and Duflo, Forscher and Lai, Dovidio, Axt 2017)
(maybe split out into "How can we measure bias in vignettes or cases?")
(historical: LaPiere 1934)

Why are we even doing this?  Because of national survey data showing that explicit attitudes around racial equity have changed dramatically over the last few decades (see Lai 2017 for citations).  Yet recent work by Axt (2017) "aligns with work showing relatively high percentages of participants willing to self-report beliefs or motives that may be considered socially unacceptable."  This "highlights that at least some people are quite willing to express preferences, beliefs, and motivations that privilege some groups over others, and that perhaps concerns over social desirability in self-report measures have been overstated" (Axt 2017).  This has been examined in laboratory settings as direct as when participants administer electric shocks (Cox and Devine 2014).

"there are no established paradigms used for assessing such biases that (1) are reliable, (2) can distinguish clearly whether bias has occurred within an individual, and (3) are adaptable for a variety of research uses" (Axt el al. 2016a)

(overall: explicit measures, indirect measures, implicit measures, behavioral measures (not latency or priming), non-verbal behavioral measures (see SI for Axt et al. 2016; Gawronski and Bodenhausen 2014 for one; Correll and older docs for police shooting etc.).)

The concept of implicit social cognition, and implicit attitudes within psychology is not new (eg, Allport).  And while much work has been published focusing on implicit social cognition (eg, following Greenwald and Banaji 1995), recent work suggests that...

LaPiere (1934) looked at Chinese couples touring the United States, and found that while 95% of them were served, 92% of establishments responded to letters of inquiry that they would not accept Chinese customers (see Ajzen et al. 2004 for wider historical examples).

Explicit measures (...)
Axt 2017

Indirect explicit measures have been used as well.  And "while such measures dampen social desirability concerns, they may weaken measurement quality by assessing construct-irrelevant attitudes, thereby lowering correspondence between measure and construct" (Axt 2017).

If we draw from implicit social cognition, then we must not "inform the subject of what is being assessed" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).  Work on "evaluation apprehension" (Rosenberg 1969, as cited in Greenwald and Banaji 1995) may also inform the design of measurements.

Greenwald and Banaji (1995) describe three categories of indirect measures: Judgment Latency Measures, Projective Measures and Other Indirect Measures like physical distance, eye contact, behavioral measures.
Implicit measures include the implicit association test (IAT), the single-target implicit association test (ST-IAT), go-no-go association task (GNAT), brief implicit association test (BIAT), evaluative or affective priming tasks, affective misattribution procedure (AMP), sorted paired features (SPF) (see http://peoplescience.org/node/99).  (see Blanton and Mitchell and Tetlock for critiques, beware bias).  IAT studies showing predictive of behavior, but with big caveats based on Lai et al. (2016) and Forscher et al. (2016) are McConnell and Liebold (2001) and Rudman and Ashmore (2007).

Audit or correspondence studies (Bertrand and Duflo), including a recent meta-analysis finding a "striking persistence of racial discrimination in US labor markets" (Quillian 2017, see Forcher tweet for caution).  With statistical discrimination, these "use (observable) race to proxy for unobservable skills" (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004 citiing Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973).  In these studies, "the black steel worker may be thought of as producing blackness as well as steel, both evaluated in the market" (Arrow 1973).  Interestingly this analysis assumes that "there are two groups of workers, to be denoted by B and W, which are perfect substitutes in production" (Arrow 1973).

There are also many challenges with generalization of measures, and sensitivity to particular settings.  Social desirability bias may be particularly influential here, where "positive bias in the attitudes of participants when they were surveyed by a university" (Lüke and Grosche 2016).

Gaps between beliefs and action are well-studied in psychology, so that confounds.  But work in teacher development confirms this for racial justice issues.  Maybe "practice spaces" are uniquely suited to this as Viesca 2013 describes: "Further, this case study illustrates the potential inconsistency in teachers claiming to teach for social justice and the practices that emerge from actual beliefs endorsing hegemonic ideologies that distribute power and privilege based on race, class, gender, language, ability, etc."  And several studies "suggest that stereotypes are often expressed implicitly in the behavior of persons
who explicitly disavow the stereotype" (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).

(see Consensual stereotype accuracy, ie "ask them to estimate the college graduation rates for five demographic groups" from Jussim web)

Can we measure from video? (Richeson and Shelton 2005)


### What confounds can impact resume or vignette studies measuring discrimination?
(core: challenges with limited information (see Jussim, careful about his tone), in a way that's fundamentally different than in teaching.  teachers know this too, it comes up in sessions. "when personal information is absent, or ambiguous, people do rely on their stereotypes" from Jussim (web2) "If people were rational, they would use stereotypes ...when available individuating information is ambiguous or incompletely useful")
(conflict: Jussim 2016 conflicts with Axt JBT study, with Uhlman et al. 2010)
(core: reasonable inference for other relevant attributes, a la William et al. 2015)
As Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) write, "while the names we have used in this experiment strongly signal racial origin, they may also signal some other personal trait."  And as they note, "there is significant variation in callback rates by name," although the sample size is small enough that this may just be from chance (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004).  Previous work (Fryer and Levitt 2003) has looked at differences in names by race during different periods of time, and correlations with socioeconomic status.

![callback rates]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/callback-rates.png)

Participants may also read names as differentially racialized (or, similarly, genderized).  Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and Simonsohn (2016) have examples like this:

  ![ratings of race]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/race-ratings.png)

Familiarity of names may be a factor, and that could be disambiguated by looking at national rates (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004), but this may also be sensitive to local differences at the regional or domain level, let alone individual relationships that participants have.  Bertrand and Mullainathan find some evidence that "employers located in more African-American neighborhoods appear to discriminate somewhat less" (2004).

Names "may signal numerous identity characteristics other than race (e.g., class, birthplace, linguistic proficiency), making it difficult to single out race as the sole source of the discriminatory behavior we observed in our study (Milkman et al. 2015).

Another resume study looking at hiring decisions based on university credentials incidentally failed to replication findinds of racial discrimination (Deming et al. 2016), which raised questions about how the sampling of names can influence these findings, and whether there are confounds related to the perception of socioeconomic status (Simonsohn 2016).

(see resume and audit studies table: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jjuGb3pbYAQn2Qtnu3sos7cRDpqilCGtnfrmMi8hPxo/edit#slide=id.g26425b7e7d_0_15)

If the dual-processing hypothesis is true, we don't have evidence that these reflect "instantaneous, automatic decision-making" processes (Dee and Gershenson 2017), and in fact most designs study deliberative decisions (eg., Glock 2016; Okonofua and Eberhardt 2015; Gilliam et al. 2016).

"Hypothetical bias" may influence how folks respond and lead to an "overestimation of willingness to pay" (see Ajzen et al. 2004 for more citations).  It's unclear how this might generalize to teaching decisions.

With images, physical attractiveness (see Greenwald and Banaji 1995 for citations)

Social desirability can influence this.  "To the extent that unconscious bias may be contributing to discrimination, unobtrusive methods for studying discrimination are critical" (Milkman et al. 2015).

The "body of research provides no support whatsoever for the common presumption that the ways and conditions under which people rely on stereotypes routinely reduces person perception accuracy" (Jussim web).

Applying notions of "equal opportunity" (Hardt el al. 2016) don't apply to vignettes and case studies, since "most of the studies examining these issues have examined experimentally created fictitious targets who had no “real” attributes, so that there was no criteria with which to assess accuracy" (Jussim )

"greater pro-White biases may be observed by introducing more ambiguity into the materials (e.g., Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000)" (in Axt et al. 2016a)



### What specific stereotypes might people hold?
(core: Axt)
- black: poor, jazz, slavery, Harlem, and busing (Greenwald and Banaji 1995, describing Devine 1989)
- men: greater achievement than women (see Greenwald and Banaji 1995 for citations)
- men: aggression (see Greenwald and Banaji 1995 for citations)
- women: dependence (see Greenwald and Banaji 1995 for citations)
- black: "Morally lax. Criminal. Adulterous. Irresponsible. Unemployed" (Williams et al. 2015) including variations in life history strategy like "reproductive timing, sexual promiscuity, investment in children, investment in education, and inclinations toward risk-taking and opportunistic criminality" (Williams et al. 2015) like "more likely to be sexually unrestricted, impulsive, and engage in socially opportunistic behaviors such as physical aggression and violence" and "arguably the most prominent stereotypes about American blacks are that they are physically threatening, criminally inclined, sexually promiscuous, and disinclined to delay gratification"
- black: lazy / determined to succeed, dependable / hardworking, aggressive/violent / self-discipline (Peffley, Hurwitz & Sniderman, 1997)


### What can we do to counteract unconscious bias directly?
(core: habit-breaking workshop.  Forscher, Lai et al. 2016, Burgess 2007; Lai 2017)

(disagree! "Long before social policies take into account the many divisions and segments of any society, we must contend with the mental barriers to equal treatment" (Lai 2017))

(also: thought suppression doesn't work (weak and general: Wenzlaff and Wegner 2000, via Dee and Gershensen 2017)
(but "when a decision maker is aware of the source and nature of a bias in judgment, that bias may effectively be anticipated and avoided" from Greenwald and Banaji 1995)

"It is important to note that these proposed strategies have not yet been tested in the realm of health care and should undergo rigorous evaluation before widespread adoption" (Burgess 2007)  Additionally, the IAT is typically used to "engender negative emotional states that motivate people to become more sensitive to and attempt to counteract the effects of unconscious prejudice and stereotypes" (Burgess 2007).

"looking at each person as an individual instead of lumping them together" and noticing and counteracting tendencies towards making generalizations about groups of people (Cohn-Vargas web 2015).

For "unintended discrimiation", blinding, consciousness raising and affirmative action were initially identified as promising interventions in the implicit social cognition literature (Greenwald and Banaji 1995).

Systematize (although problematize with concern about structural racism as same mechanism): "systems to nudge decision-makers away from the unintended biases that affect their informal decisions" (Milkman et al. 2015).  See "Black job candidates and college applicants experience more bias when their qualifications are ambiguous, rather than clearly strong or clearly weak" (Milkman et al. 2015, citing the work of others).

"evaluation nudge" (see Bohnet et al. 2012)

avoid external pressure, particularly "politically correct" and increase understanding around psychological basis (Burgess et al. 2007)

skeptical: underlying psychological mechanism for social categorization based on alliances, of which race is a learned cue that can be easily counteracted with in-groups (Kurzban et al. 2001; Pietraszewski et al. 2014)

"people who are induced with a motivation to be accurate are more likely to rely on individuating information about others, and less likely to depend on their stereotypical expectations" (Ulhmann et al. 2010, citing other work)


### What about prejudice reduction or diversity training more broadly?
(core: Paluck)
(see: KALINOSKI, BEZRUKOVA)
(strategies: Hollins and Govan book)
(critique: Noon 2017)

Importantly, the approach depends on the theoretical framing, and whether this is a conscious belief, attitude, "intention-behavior discrepancies," or unconscious bias.

Ajzen (1985) proposed the Theory of Planned Behavior, which hypothesizes that intention is a function of attitude towards the behavior, and that this is influenced by perceptions of norms and individual control. (*this is sloppy*).  Many questions about this (see Ajzen 2011 and Haggar 2015 for citations).


----------------------------
# In teaching
### How do we know that "this" impacts teaching in particular?
(skepticism from Jussim)
Emails to professors (Moss-Racusin; Milkman).  MOOC comments (Dee et al. 2015), although only for white males by instructors and not for peers.

addressing others:
(strategies: mindset interventions, wise interventions more broadly)
(caution about generalization in wise interventions: Gerber replication, sensitivity to timing "this kind of psychology is ephemeral" according to Bryan).
(caution: Hanselman replications of self-affirmation interventions closing racial achievement gap)

(pit-ten cate 2017 intervention strategies)

Expectations by teacher and student race (core: Gershenson et al. 2015, Jussim and Harber 2005; Rubie-Davies 2009).
Rubie-Davies (2009) reviews various ways teacher expecations shape teacher behavior, including giving "more challenging and faster-paced work," teaching "more concepts and more difficult concepts," or grouping students based on class (look at Rist 1970 and Jussim et al. 1998 for more).  Further, Rubie-Davies review ways that expectations can be influenced, claiming that "two student characteristics that researchers generally agree have the greatest impact on teachers' expecations are student social class and diagnostic labels" (Rubie-Davies 2009, although beware of racial erasure here).  Physical attractiveness or past relationships with a sibling influenced expectations for academic performance but was short-lived after meeting the student (see Jussim et al. 1998, Dusek and Joseph 1985).  Others including having taught students with the same name, language style, personality, background (see Dusek and Joseph 1985).  This has been looked at internationally as well (Rubie-Davies et al. 2012) and in elementary schools for hispanic students in particular that led to theoretical development of Expectations States Theory (Cohen 1982).
(see Delplit 2012, Yanisko 2016)

Some students receive more positive attention and input from teachers, be "given less responsibility for their learning, fewer intellectually stimulating tasks and reduced opportunities to work collaboratively with peers," or not being given an opportunity to take books home to study (Rubie-Davies 2009).

Or maybe no effect based on teacher characteristics (McKown and Weinstein 2008).

(see also Google reports and MIT UB website)

"The evidence from both experimental and naturalistic studies indicates that people apply their stereotypes when judging others approximately rationally.  When individuating information is absent or ambiguous, stereotypes often influence person perception.  When individuating information is clear and relevant, its effects are “massive” (Kunda & Thagard, 1996, yes, that is a direct quote, p. 292), and stereotype effects tend to be weak or nonexistent.  This puts the lie to longstanding claims that “stereotypes lead people to ignore individual differences.”" (Jussim web)


### How else might "it" impact teaching?
(core: deficit is milner, margolis, Carlson 2014, valencia 2010)
(making assumptions about students based on some attribute about them, interpreting a situation with a student in one particular way based on assumptions about their intention, motivation, etc.)
(expectations)
labeled "at-risk" or called "minorities" when their ethnicity is 97% of the school (Burciaga web).
deficit: position students with lack of motivation, inadequate socialization from home (Valencia 2010), perspectives "rooted in her sense that her cultural frame was ‘normal’ and her students’ cultural frame was inferior and abnormal" (Hyland 2009).

feeling invisible, tokenized, others repeating claims and treated as "brilliant" (Burciaga web)

(this Dee and Gershenson 2017 below is weak:)
"This" may look like "signalling lower expectations for female students by over-praising females for giving correct answers in class" that causes students stress (Dee and Gershenson 201 7, describing stereotype threat).  And there are two ways this might harm: "First, behavior modification occurs when stereotyped groups modify their own behaviors to conform to negative biases [kevin: this is cutting out any mention of access and opportunity prior]. Second, teachers may modify how they teach, evaluate, and advise outgroup students, again leading to poor educational outcomes for such students."  Or "the UB of teachers, principals, and peers might affect school climate and students’ expectations, effort, and attitudes."

Same-race teachers suspend black students less for "willful defiance" (Lindsay and Hart 2017).

Black students less likely to be assigned to gifted programs, and referred at lower rates by non-black teachers (Grissom and Reading 2016).

Microaggressions (see Sue, Rowe, Meeks, Wong et al. 2014 for a review).  This can also impact teachers through "leakage" in non-verbal behaviors (Babad et al. 1989).  See Lilienfield (2017) for pushback (caution for bias).

(track down Yeager et al. 2014:)
"A large body of research attests to the subtle and not-so-subtle cues that send the message to minority students that they are seen as lacking and as not belonging in school (Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Walton & Cohen, 2007). These include, among others things, harsher disciplinary actions, colder social treatment, and patronizing praise (e.g., Harber et al., 2012; Wallace, Goodkind, Wallace, & Bachman, 2008)"

See Aronson and Laughter (2016) for thorough review of work showing how cultural relevant education can impact student outcomes (for perspectives on ultimately outcome measures for effectiveness of teacher development).

White, Murray, and Brunard-Vega (2012)


### What assumptions or stereotypes are hypothesized to influence teachers?
(see above for more general, not within teaching)
- ethnicity: Maori homes are less supportive of education in New Zealand, Pakistani homes in Britain (Rubie-Davies et al. 2006, Huss-Keeler 1997)


### How can we measure bias and discrimination within teaching?
(upcoming: Shah, McGee, look at Gregory measures? and van Es)
Within education, implicit measures have been used to measure attitudes towards inclusive education (Lüke and Grosche 2017).

This approach has been adopted to teaching using vignette and case studies in a variety of ways internationally, including varying the student's race (Chang and Sue 2003), special education status (Pit-Ten Cate 2017, 2017, Stinnett et al. 2001), ethnicity (Glock; Elhoweris et al. 2005; Myles and Ratzlaff 1988), weight (Muller et al. 2017), race and class together (McCombs and Gay 1988), and even race, physical attractiveness and gender together (Parks and Kennedy 2007).  Overall, these studies have had mixed results with regards to confirming whether individual findings are generalizable, and it's unclear whether there are consistent and systematic biases in teacher populations.  Early work has investigated the ecological validity of these assessments, and whether performance generalizes to in situ measurements (Krolak-Schwerdt et al. 2017).

Some work has directly investigated the relationship in teachers between explicit attitudes and implicit attitudes as measured by the IAT (Glock and Klapproth 2017).  

Importantly, most of these designs involved making judgements or evaluations about students, or rating likeliness to engage in a future behavior.  Some measured whether teachers referred students for a gifted and talented program differentially by ethnicity (Plata and Masten 1998, Elhoweris et al. 2005) or English language proficiency (Fernandez et al. 1998), referral to special education programs by ethnicity (Myles and Ratzlaff 1988).

In video settings, researchers have examined whether ratings of ADHD symptoms varied by ethnicity (Domínguez de Ramírez and Shapiro 2005), or looked at how eye movement indicates attention differentially given by race (Gilliam).  Generally we can also look at "noticing" in the spirit of Jacobs et al. (2010) and van Es and Sherin (2002) when applied to perceptions of student belonging, margilization and teacher bias and equity practices.

Researchers have examined conscious teacher expression of stereotypes by race and ethnicity (Change and Demyan 2007).  Others have looked at teachers expectations, and whether they different by student race (Dabach et al. 2017; Gershenson; Cherng 2017; Tenenbaum and Ruck 2007), or whether they are influenced by cultural capital (Jæger and Møllegaard 2017).

Finally, another angle to measuring bias is to look at coarse outcome measures like graduation rates, suspenions, referrals to the office or referrals to the school nurse (Schneider and Grimes 1993), and referral rates for special (Hosp and Reschly 2003; Low and Clement 1982; MacMillan et al. 1996; *incomplete*).

In the classroom, TGDS from Oakland, sections 2A, for example "accepts different registers of language and explicitly teach their appropriate use in different contexts (code-switching)" and "addresses systems of power and privilege, even in mono-cultural classrooms, in a way that decreases bias and increases equity (SEL)" (TGDS Handbook 2015).



### How can we apply this theory to understanding particular teaching decisions?
While much progress has been made in articulating how statistical discrimination in particular might naturally lead to biased decisions (citation), "distinguishing desirable bias from harmful bias in data science is hard, and requires domain expertise" (Narayanan tweet 2017).  This is particularly true in a profession like teaching, which is "a complex, situated, and ill-defined activity" (Hatch and Grossman 2009).

In teaching, "what one person sees in one classroom or in the work of a teacher may be quite different from what others see" (Hatch and Grossman 2009).  And in contrast to statistical settings, where there is perfect information about outcomes, teachers "cannot be usre exactly what students  willb e doing in the future or whether what students do in teh classrom one day or in one year will necessarily lead them to behavior approprateily or act successfully in related sitautions in the future.

Within medicine, Anwar and Fang (2012) tried to distinguish by less empathy with patient suffering.

In attitude research, measurements are often trying to get at underlying attitudes that would be true in many circumstances.  As such, "indirect measures of self-reported racial attitudes introduce construct-irrelevant information; for instance, opinions towards affirmative action involve construct-relevant components, like racial preferences, but also constructirrelevant components, like thoughts on educational policy" (Axt 2017).  However in the context of teacher education, we are less interested in general attitudes and more interested in what influences particular teaching decisions.



### What are promising ways to investigate this within teaching?
- Can we see bias in the way that teachers fill in incomplete information within simulations, based on their reflections and interpretations?
- What do you think the most likely reason for disengagement is (a, b, c) when varying race?  Similar to Jayden anticipation questions.  Do this forced-choice after open-ended question.
- Do explicit self-report measures of Milner's educator mindsets correlate with observed behavior in simulations?
- Do we see different rates of belief/action mismatch like Ashby and Dotger (2010) related to race, ethnicity or gender?
- If we ask teachers to describe beliefs around aggregate statistical realities, do those match difference in observed behavior in simulations?
- Can simulation methods with forced timing reveal differences that are not present in deliberative decision making designs (even those publications suggest it is present in those designs like Glock 2016 and Okonofua and Eberhardt 2015?).

"Researchers should develop measurement tools, ones that music educators can have easy access to, to help identify any biases teachers have toward their students" (Gardner 2015)

"individual differences in shifting standards may also be assessed by first providing participants with relatively objective evaluation criteria (e.g., GPA), and seeing where they then create subjective admission standards for each race." (Axt et al. 2016a)



### What aspects of student identity lead teachers to make assumptions?
(race, class, gender)
(within CS: )


### Where can bias most impact students?
Unconscious bias may impact "academic performance, engagement with school, course and major choice, and persistence in higher education" (Gershenson and Dee 2017). (?this is a stretch)


### What can teachers do about this?
(core values: get to know your students, treat students as individuals)
(strategies: empathize, use asset framing, guard)
(anchor: Gershenson and Dee, Forscher)
(field: Gregory et al. 2014; Gregory et al. 2016)

From Gregory and Fergus (2017), "to advance equity, educators
could examine their own conscious and unconscious beliefs, and consider whether they hold negative stereotypes about students’ cultural and stylistic codes... and examine how their unconscious
beliefs affect their decision-making."

Video coaching around student expectations (Hafen et al. 2015) can improve expecatations even for students with behavior problems, and has been shown to reduce racial disparities in discipline practices (Gregory et al. 2017).

Practice empathizing with students' experiences (while emphasizing the importance of their own individual responsibility).  (related to Viesca et al. 2014, where "The emphasis has moved from “understanding inequity” to becoming an ally").

Practice seeing student strengths.  Building from empathy, "building relationships of care" is a key strategy to disrupt deficit frames (Paris 2015) Finding mismatches between their strengths and interests and school, rather than seeing them as lacking.

In situations that are high-stakes for a student, check when you're making assumptions that shape your judgments, evaluations or decisions about them.

(connect to "we're not average people")
(envision seeing their future (see Burciaga web, Rafalow))


### What are other specific strategies in CS?
(see: Lewis for classroom things)
(classroom decor)
(tips: http://csteachingtips.org/tips-for-reducing-bias)


### How do teachers develop as equitable, unbiased, or anti-racist practitioners?
(core: Milner 2010)
(see Utt and Tochluk, Lawrence and Tatum 2012)
(case studies: Self 2016; Hyland 2009; Milner 2010)

Some teacher educators (eg., Dotger, Self) believe that repeated practice is unlikely to be an effective pedagogical approach to develop skills like cultural awareness, competency, critical reflection and pedagogical responsibility.  


### What gets in the way for teachers?
(core: Milner, Carlson 2014, our early SIGCSE)
"majoritarian stories" (Viesca et al. 2014)
...colorblindness or racial erasure (Milner, Carlson 2014, Mitchell 2013; Gregory and Fergus 2017), deficit view (Milner, Margolis, Carlson 2014, Mitchell 2013), meritocracy (Milner, Mitchell 2013), non-intersectionality (Milner), equity as sameness (Milner), avoidance and employment of the gaze (Carlson), paralogical beliefs and behaviors (Carlson 2014, Valencia 2010).
alternate to Milner: There is no story about race, Difference is deficit, Meritocracy is appropriate (see case study in Viesca 2013)
(look at Brown and Crippen 2016)

"Teachers who fail to understand that racism is systemic may perceive colorblindness as a more elevated form of social awareness" (Gregogy and Fergus 2017)

"educators’ own social and emotional competencies strongly influence students’ motivation to learn and the school climate in general" (Gregory and Fergus 2017)

Frames that focus on "mastery" or "developmental trajectories over time" conceptualize learning objectives for teachers educators quite differently.  Frames that narrowly define pedagogical responsibility to be focused on externally-defined assessments within the classroom will conceptualize this different that those that see teaching fundamentally as an act of "doing democracy."  We can encode this in the curriculum materials, but may have the most success in dissemination in targeting teacher education programs with high coherence (e.g., code.org).

Cultural bias gets in the way with implementing CRP (weak on substance: Young 2010), and "Unless European American teachers seriously analyze and change their cultural biases
and ethnic prejudices (toward self and others) they are not likely to be very diligent and effective in helping students to do" (Gay and Howard 2000).

"pressure to cover materials" or "preference for the traditional curriculum" (Young 2010)

working conditions (see Rafalow)

Using "unbiasing" as a frame may reinforce colorblind mindsets when "unbiased does not mean color blind" (Cross et al. 1989).  Using counter-examples may lend support narratives around equal opportunity that encourage colorblind perspectives and make structural advantages and disadvantages less visible.

Other researchers (Self, Reed, Brandon) have emphasized the role that frames like "colorblind" and "deficit thinking" interfere with pre-service teachers' enactment of equitable and just practices in the classroom.

Misperceptions of racial economic equity (Kraus 2017)

"prevailing “colorblind” notions of SEL don’t consider power, privilege, and cultural difference—thus ignoring how individual beliefs and structural biases can lead educators to react harshly to behaviors that fall outside a white cultural frame of reference" (Gregory and Fergus 2017)


----------------------------
# Mixing perspectives
### How can we describe teacher development related to bias, cultural awareness and culturaly competency?


### How promising is unconscious bias as an intervenion point, as compared to other approaches like culturally responsive teaching, structural elements, or explicit systems of advantage and favortism?
(see Milkman in that these were all anonymous letters, same for Mullaithan)

(see Aronson and Laughter 2016 for history and definitions:)
culturally repsonsive teaching (Gay 2010; Gay 2013), culturally responsive pedagogy (Ladson-Billings 1994; Ladson-Billings 2014), culturally sustaining pedagogy (Paris 2012).

Challenges with dissemination, implementation fidelity, where Ladson-Billings claims "what I see in the literature and sometimes in practice is totally unrecognizable to me" (2014).


### How can we reason about the way competing biases interact?
Within K12 computer science, competing claims may interact.  As an example, there may be a pro-female bias in K12 settings overall, a pro-male bias within computer science, and a pro-Asian bias in computer science.  For a teacher, how might these biases influence how they interact with a single young Asian woman?  One answer here is that while decomposing these effects by single attributes like gender, race or ethnicity is a hallmark of systematic analysis and understanding, that this may be at odds with generating productive knowledge.  More intersectional approaches may be necessary (Crenshaw 1991).

Attempts to quantify bias like the Judgement Bias Task (Axt et al. 2016) are promising but require a discrete quantitative approach to characterizing bias (e.g., "levels need to be designed such that there can be objectively correct responses") and presume simplistic linear relationships between profile information and the "right" choice (Axt et al. web).  This is challenging for relational work like teaching, which is "a complex, situated, and ill-defined activity" (Hatch and Grossman 2009).


### What does bias have to do with culturally responsive teaching?
being present in the community (a la JC in Brooklyn) or even live and learn with students in community during the summer (Dominguez 2015; see also Paris 2015)
teaching "within" cultural communities (see Paris 2015)
"Culturally relevant teaching is about questioning (and preparing students to question) the structural inequality, the racism, and the injustice that exists in society.  The teachers I studies work in opposition to the system that employs them" (Ladson-Billings 1994)
see also funds of knowledge, pedagogical third space
"educators' socialised views around gender influence the ways in which they teach boys" (Bristol 2015)

### How does this relate to initiatives focused on diversity and inclusion?
cooperative learning (Cohen 1982; Aronson; Jigsaw web)

### What does bias have to do with strategies like disrupting preparatory privilege?

### What does bias have to do with colorblindness?

### What does bias have to do with meritocracy or beliefs about competition?
(formed from beliefs in meritocracy)
(see Aronson; Jigsaw web esp. for quotes)

### How does bias relate to structural or institutional forms of oppression?
Disproportionality is complex (Kramarczuk Voulgaries and Zwerger)

### How does this relate to advantages or favortism?
(see: DiTomaso 2015)

### How does this connect with larger ways to look at social justice within education?
(see Mitchell et al. 2016 for really wide review of philosophy etc.)


### How does this relate to microaggressions?


### How have people understood opportunity gaps in K12?
(see Blickenstaff 2005 for core gender; Cimpian et al. 2016 for others)
(see Reardon and Portilla 2017 for racial and ethnic gaps at kindergarten)
(see Bassock et al. 2016 for SES gaps, including "more access to educational games on computers")
"a window into long-standing issues in the educational technology literature around implementation, equity, and student achievement" (Ahn et al. 2016)

### How have people understood gaps in higher education or industry?
"it is clear that women are less likely to choose certain STEM majors, those who do are no less likely to earn a STEM degree" (King 2016)


# Students
### Differences in interests?
"they do not address why these preferences are there in the first place, and why gender differences in preferences for computer science are so different from gender differences in preferences for mathematics…Our analysis reveals that women’s and men’s preferences do not develop in a vacuum but are constrained and expanded by cultural factors" (Cheryan et al. 2017)
(see Su et al. 2009)

Teachers need long-term, but hard to do.  We give inroads into others (eg., Margolis, Milner)
